**griptape** is a modular Python framework for LLM workflows, tools, memory, and data 

## Core Packages

- [griptape](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape): build LLM agents, workflows, and pipelines with memory, rules, and chain of thought reasoning. Integrate other services and functionality into LLMs as tools; run tools in any environment (local, containerized, cloud, etc.); convert tools into underlying middleware abstractions, such as ChatGPT Plugins, LangChain tools, and Fixie.ai agents.
